## Computer Architecture [[link]]()
- Project 1: Simple MIPS assembler
- Project 2: Building a Simple MIPS Emulator
- Project 3: Simulating Pipelined Execution
- Project 4: Multi-level Cache Model and Performance Analysis
- using c++

## Computer Vision [[link]]()
- Project 1
    - Reduce noise and enhance image contrast through filtering in both the spatial and frequency domains.
- Project 2 
    - Image classification using conventional analytical (mathematical) methods such as the Bayes classifier and a simple CNN.
- Project 3
    - Perform camera calibration using a (cellphone) camera and implement a virtual ruler.
- using python

## System Programming [[link]]()
- HW 1
    - Implementation of simple bitwise operations
- HW 2
    - Modify the provided code and implement an optimized procedure that performs the same functionality with improved performance. 
    - As a result, achieved a 4x performance improvement
- Team Project
    - Programming involving robot control, communication with servers, path planning, strategy, and real-time QR code detection and decoding.
- using c

## Digital Image Processing [[link]]()
- HW 1
    - Implementation of an interpolation method
- HW 3
    - Implementation of noise filtering and edge enhancement in the spatial and frequency domains.
- using MATLAB

## Deep Learning [[link]]()
- Programming Assignment 1 : Neural Network design
    - (Main) 3-layer Neural Network for Classification without the deep learning framework (only python)
    - (Extra credit) 3-layer Neural Network for Classification using a deep learning framework (e.g. pytorch, tensorflow)

- Programming Assignment 2 : Convolutional Neural Network
    - (Main) Convolution Neural Network for Classification without deep learning framework
    - (Extra credit) Visualize the activation map using Class Activation Map using the author provided code

- Programming Assignment 3 : Recurrent Neural Network
    - (Main) Recurrent Neural Network for sentiment analysis generation without deep learning framework
    - If you cannot design the networks without DL framework,
you can use DL framework (but, you will only get 30% score of total)
- using python
