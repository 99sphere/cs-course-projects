# Project 1: Simple MIPS assembler
The goal of this assignment is to implement a MIPS ISA assembler that converts MIPS (Big-endian) assembly code into binary code. The assembler that needs to be developed for this assignment has a simple structure, as it does not perform complex tasks such as linking. Therefore, considerations like symbols and relocation tables used by modern compilers are not required.

# Project 2: Building a Simple MIPS Emulator
The goal of the second assignment is to implement a simple MIPS emulator that can execute MIPS instructions. While the first assignment involved converting assembly code into binary, the objective of this assignment is to create an emulator that takes the generated binary as input, loads it into memory, and executes the instructions. As the instructions are executed, the states of the registers and memory will change.

# Project 3: Simulating Pipelined Execution
The third assignment is an extension of the emulator implemented in the second assignment, where the task is to implement a five-stage pipeline for the MIPS ISA. A pipeline is a technique that divides the process of handling instructions into several stages, allowing each stage to operate in parallel. The instructions that the emulator must support are the same as those in the first and second assignments, and any details not mentioned in the assignment description should follow the course materials.

# Project 4: Multi-level Cache Model and Performance Analysis

The goal of this assignment is to implement and experiment with a two-level cache simulator to understand the basic structure of a cache.
