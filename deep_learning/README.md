# Deep Learning
## Programming Assignment 1 : Neural Network design
- (Main) 3-layer Neural Network for Classification without the deep learning framework (only python)
- (Extra credit) 3-layer Neural Network for Classification using a deep learning framework (e.g. pytorch, tensorflow)


## Programming Assignment 2 : Convolutional Neural Network
- (Main) Convolution Neural Network for Classification without deep learning framework
- (Extra credit) Visualize the activation map using Class Activation Map using the author provided code
- input image & class activation map

## Programming Assignment 3 : Recurrent Neural Network
- (Main) Recurrent Neural Network for sentiment analysis generation without deep learning framework
- If you cannot design the networks without DL framework, you can use DL framework (but, you will only get 30% score of total)
